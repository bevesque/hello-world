# hello-world
A learning repository

Lets make some changes. I enjoy long walks on the beach and holding hands with my girlfriend.
I also enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, videogames, painting miniatures, and learning!

Lets make some more edits. This will be something I add to the current readme and I'll look over later and laugh and laugh.

WHOOPS! I didn't make a different branch, I made the change to the MASTER document. UH OH, lets try not to make that mistake again!
